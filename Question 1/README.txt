The idea of Encryption and Decryption in 'question 1' is not supported
by character encodings (like ASCII, Unicode).
The task has specific rules in order to encrypt and decrypt the data
and because of this the use of ASCII or Unicode encryption is irreversible.
For this program we used custom mapping of alphabets as well as variables
containing two halves of alphabets. This idea fits perfectly for program's
requirement.
We created three python programs encryption.py and decryption.py which are
classes and acts as modules for Main.py.
To avoid FileNotFound Error, VSCode or any other editor needs to be run inside
"Question 1" folder.
