This program uses turtle graphics and recursion to draw a geometric pattern. The idea is that instead of
drawing a straight line for each side of a shape, the program replaces the line with a smaller repeated pattern.
The main recursive function is called inward_koch_edge. If the recursion depth is zero, the turtle simply draws 
a straight line and stops. This is the base case, and it prevents the recursion from running forever.
If the depth is greater than zero, the function divides the line into three equal parts and draws four
smaller segments. Between these segments, the turtle turns left and right at specific angles to create an 
inward triangular shape. The function then calls itself on each smaller segment with a reduced depth.
Another function, draw_recursive_polygon, uses this recursive edge to build a full polygon. It calculates
how much the turtle needs to turn after each side so that the shape closes properly. It also uses some basic 
trigonometry to position the shape near the centre of the screen.
Overall, the program shows how recursion can be used to generate complex patterns by repeatedly applying simple drawing rules.
