Create a program that analyses temperature data collected from multiple weather 
stations in Australia. The data is stored in multiple CSV files under a "temperatures" 
folder, with each file representing data from one year. 
Process ALL .csv files in the temperatures folder.
Ignore missing temperature values (NaN) in calculations. 

**Main Functions to Implement:** 
1. Seasonal Average: Calculate the average temperature for each season across ALL stations and ALL years. Save the results to "average_temp.txt".
   • Use Australian seasons: Summer (Dec-Feb), Autumn (Mar-May), Winter (Jun-Aug), Spring (Sep-Nov)
   • Output format example: "Summer: 28.5°C" 
2. Temperature Range: Find the station(s) with the largest temperature range (difference between the highest and lowest temperature ever recorded at that station).
   • Save the results to "largest_temp_range_station.txt".
   • Output format example: "Station ABC: Range 45.2°C (Max: 48.3°C, Min: 3.1°C)" 
**If multiple stations tie, list all of them** 
3. Temperature Stability: Find which station(s) have the most stable temperatures (smallest standard deviation) and which have the most variable temperatures (largest standard deviation).
   • Save the results to "temperature_stability_stations.txt".
   • Output format example:
   o "Most Stable: Station XYZ: StdDev 2.3°C"
   o "Most Variable: Station DEF: StdDev 12.8°C" 
**If multiple stations tie, list all of them**
